# ESPLinter

ARCHIVED BECAUSE THIS FUNCTIONALITY WAS IMPLEMENTED IN SPRIGGIT ITSELF.

WILL UNARCHIVE IF ANYTHING ELSE NEEDS ATTENDING TO.

Eventual goal is to curb the randomization that happens between xEdit/CK and a spriggified plugin. WYSIWYG as possible.

Right now it only sorts script properties in alphabetical order.
